[verse]

A
When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
D                                                         A
When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
           E7                                      A
But when a man gets blues he grabs him a train and rides


[verse]

Looky yonder coming coming down the railroad track
D                                            A
Looky yonder coming coming down the railroad track
            E7                                              A
And see the black smoke rolling rolling from that old smoke stack

[verse]
A
Every time I see that lonesome railroad train
D                                            A
Every time I see that lonesome railroad train
            E7                                              A
And see the black smoke rolling rolling from that old smoke stack

I feel so bad that the whole round world looks blue
               E7                         A
