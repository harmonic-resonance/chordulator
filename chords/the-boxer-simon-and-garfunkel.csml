Title: THE BOXER (Simon)

C Am

I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told

G

I have squandered my resistance

G7 G6 C

For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises

Am G F

All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear

C G G7 G6 C

And disregards the rest

C Am

When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy

G

In the company of strangers

G7 G6 C

In the quiet of a railway station, running scared

Am G F

Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters

C

Where the ragged people go

G G7 G6 C

Looking for the places only they would know

Am G Am G F C

Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie

C Am

Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job

G

But I get no offers

G7 G6 C

Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue

Am G F

I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome

C

I took some comfort there

G G7 G6 C

Lie lie lie lie la

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone

Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me

Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade

And he carries a reminder ov ev'ry glove that laid him down

Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame

I am leaving, I am leaving

But the fighter still remains

Lie la lie ... etc.
