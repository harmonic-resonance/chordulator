C                 F       Am
Ae fond kiss, and then we sever 
                G       C
Ae farewell, and then forever 
F                   C          Am
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, 
C       Am        G               C
Warring sighs and goans I'll wage thee. 

Who shall say that Fortune grieves him, 
While the star of hope she leaves him 
Me nae cheerful twinkle lights me, 
Dark despair around benights me. 

I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy: 
Nothing could resist my Nancy 
But to see her was to love her 
Love but her, and love for ever. 

Had we never loe'd sae kindly, 
Had we never loe'd sae blindly, 
Never met - nor never parted - 
We had ne'er been broken-hearted. 

Fare thee weel, thou first and fairest 
Fare thee weel, thou best and dearest 
Thine be ilka joy and treasure, 
Peace, Enjoyment, Love and Pleasure 

Ae fond kiss, and then we sever 
Ae farewell, alas, for ever 
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, 
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
