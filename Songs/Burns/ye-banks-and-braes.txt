1. Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon,
            G           C              G            D
   how can ye bloom sae fresh and fair?
             G           D            G     D
   How can ye chaunt, ye little birds,
         G           C     G  C   G
   and I sae weary, fu' o' care ?

              G      C    G            G  C     G
   Ye'll break my heart, ye warbling birds,
            G                           Am          D
   that wanton through the flowery thorn,
          G          D       G       D
   ye mind me o' departed joys,
         G         C      G  C G
   departed, never to return.         

           G     D             G          D
2. Oft hae I roved by bonnie Doon,
         G         C              G              D
   to see the rose and woodbine twine,
          G     D            G      D
   and ilka bird sang o' its love,
           G        C        G C   G
   and fondly sae did I  o' mine.

         G      C       G        G   C  G
   Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose
            G                  Am      D
   fu' sweet upon its thorny tree.
          G            D        G          D
   But my false lover stole my rose,
           G        C            G    C   G
   and Ah! he left the thorn wi' me.
