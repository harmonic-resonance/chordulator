1. When wild war's deadly blast was blown, and my gentle peace return  -  ing,
           G                                    D              G         D         Am       G
   wi' mony a sweet babe fatherless, and mony a widow mourn - ing:
  
      G                                    D                G                             D
   I left the lines and tented field, where lang I'd been a lodger;
    G                                            D           G            D        Am    G
   my humble knapsack a' my wealth, a poor and honest so  -  dger.

        G                                         D             G            D             Am       G
2. A lead light heart beat in my breast, my hands unstain'd wi' plum  -  der;
        G                            D          G     D        Am     G
   for fair Scotia hame again, I cheery on did wa  -  nder.

         G                                      D         G                             D
   I thought upon the banks o' Coil, I thought upon my Nancy;
         G                                       D              G              D         Am    G
   I thought upon the witching smile, that caught my youthful fan  -  cy.

         G                                          D              G      D     Am       G
3. At length I reach'd the bonnie glen, where early life I spor  -  ted;
      G                                         D                 G       D      Am       G
   I pass'd the mill and trysting thorn, where Nancy aft I cour  -  ted.

              G                                   D               G                               D
   Wha spied I but my ain dear maid, down by her mother's dwelling?
           G                                           D           G        D          Am      G
   And turn'd me round to hide the flood that in my e'e was swell  -  ing.

          G                                            D               G          D              Am        G
4. Wi' alter'd voice, quoth I, Sweet Lass, sweet as yon hawthorn's bloss  -  om,
         G                              D               G        D       Am     G
   O! happy, happy may he be, that's dearest to thy bo  -  som !

           G                                  D              G                             D
   My purse is light, I've far to gang, and fain wad be thy lodger,
    G                                                D                G   D     Am - D G
   I've served my king and country lang : Tak' pity on a so  -  dger.

            G                                 D          G           D           Am   G
5. Sae wistfully she gazed on me, and lovelier was than e  -  ver;
              G                               D           G            D     Am    G
   quote she, a sodger ance I lo’ed, forget him shall I ne  -  ver.
  
  

            G                                   D            G                          D
   Our humble cot and hamely fare, ye freely shall partake o't;
         G                                        D                  G            D        Am        G
   that gallant badge, the dear cockade, ye're welcome for the sa  -  ke o't.

           G                                        D               G         D    Am   G
6. She gazed - she redden'd like a rose syne pale as ony li  -   ly;
           G                                     D             G         D            Am     G
   she sank within my arms and cried, art thou my ain dear Wil  -  lie?

         G                                             D            G                              D
   By Him, who made yon son and sky, by whom true love's regarded,
      G                                         D          G        D       Am       G
   I am the man! and thus may still true lovers be reward  -  ed.

            G                                          D              G             D          Am      G
7. The wars are o'er, and I'm come hame, and find thee still true-hear -  ted;
                G                                     D                G               D         Am    G
   though poor in gear, we're rich in love, and mair we'se ne'er be par  - ted.

               G                                       D           G                          D
   Quoth she, my grandsire left me gowd a mailin' plenish'd fairly;
            G                                      D                G          D    Am - D G
   then come, my faithful sodger lad, thou'rt welcome to it dea  -  rly !

            G                                               D           G           D              Am     G
8. For gold the merchant ploughs the main, the farmer ploughs the ma  -  nor;
           G                              D             G             D         Am     G
   but glory is the sodger's prize, the sodger's wealth is hon - our.

             G                                        D              G
   The brave poor sodger ne'er despise, nor count him as a stranger:
           G                                       D         G            D       Am - D G
   Remember he's his country's stay, in day and hour o' da  -  nger.
