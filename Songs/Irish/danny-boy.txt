Danny Boy
 
         C                   C7        F      F6
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
            C        Am                Dm   G7
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
            C                C7          F     Fm
The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying
              C        G7            C    C7
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide
 
 
           C         F               C      G7
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
            C        F                    Dm   G7
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
           C C7    F              Am7    F
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
        C             Dm    G        C
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so
 
 
         C            C7        F      F6
But if he come and all the roses dying
        C        Am              Dm   G7
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
            C                     C7          F     Fm
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying
              C     G7            C    C7
And kneel and say an ava there for me
 
 
           C         F               C      G7
And I shall feel, oh soft you tread above me
            C          F              Dm   G7
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
            C C7    F              Am7    F
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
        C             Dm    G        C
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me
