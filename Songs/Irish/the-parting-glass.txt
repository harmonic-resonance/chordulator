G  Em       C         G      D
Of all the money that e'er I had,
  G               G     D 
I spent it in good company. 
     Em       C       G    D
And all the harm I've ever done, 
   G           Em       C
alas it was to none but me.
    G   C    G        G    C  D 
And all I've done for want of wit
   C            G      D 
to mem'ry now I can't recall; 
   Em    C       G        D
So fill to me the parting glass,
     G                Em     C 
Good night and joy be to you all. 

CHORUS 
     G       C      G       D 
[So] fill to me the parting glass
    D       Em          C     D 
And drink a health whate’er befalls
    Em     C        D      G 
And gently rise and softly call
     G                Em     C 
Good night and joy be to you all 

G
Of all the comrades that e'er I had, 
                           D
They're sorry for my going away.
    Em                       C     G 
And all my sweethearts that e'er I had,
G                       D      G 
They'd wish me one more day to stay.
    G       Em     G      D 
But since it fell unto my lot,
     D        Em       C          D 
That I should rise and you should not,
Em       C               G 
I gently rise and softly call,
G                     D      G 
Good night and joy be to you all.
