CHORUS:
        G     C    G   
Will ye go lassie, go? 
           C       G           
And we'll all go together 
         C             Em                                    
To pluck wild mountain thyme
      C         Am       C                        
All around the blooming heather
        G     C    G   
Will ye go lassie, go?


    G         Am         G                                       
I will build my love a bower 
         C                 G          
Near yon pure crystal fountain
       C          Em                                    
And on it I will pile
      C         Am       C                        
All the flowers of the mountain                                  

CHORUS
 
    G         Am         G                                       
If my true love she were gone 
        C              G          
I would surely find another
       C          Em                                    
Where wild mountain thyme
      C           Am       C                        
Grows around the blooming heather

CHORUS

    G         Am         G                                       
Oh, the summertime is coming 
         C                 G          
And the trees are sweetly blooming
         C             Em                                    
And the wild mountain thyme
      C           Am       C                        
Grows around the blooming heather
