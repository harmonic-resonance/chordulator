          G             C            G              Em 
It's been ten years and three since I first went to sea
        C               G           D 
Since I sailed from old Ireland and home.
           G               C             G         Em 
With those hills, lush and green where I parted my dream
       C             D       G 
When I dreamed of my Colleen Malone.
 
       G        C            G             Em
On the day I returned, to my sorrow I learned
          C          G          D 
That the angels had called her away.
      G         C        G           Em 
To a grave on a hill overlooking the mill
            C                 D        G 
That's the place where she's sleeping today.

CHORUS 
        D                            C        G 
As the soft breezes flow through the meadow I go
           C            G            D 
Past the mill with the moss-covered stone
        D                          C              G 
Up the pathway I climb thought the woods and the vines
    C          D       G 
To be with my Colleen Malone

 SOLO 
 
         G             C        G          Em 
She was faithfull each day as I sailed far away
          C          G           D 
There was no one but me that she loved.
                      C             G           Em 
And I remember those eyes, soft and blue as the skies
         C           D         G 
And her heart was as pure as a dove.

 CHORUS 

 SOLO 

         G          C           G          Em 
All the years of my life I will not take a wife
        C          G      D 
I will live in the valley alone.
         G        C             G           Em 
Planting flowers around in this soft gentle ground
         C          D       G 
That is holding my Colleen Malone.

 CHORUS
