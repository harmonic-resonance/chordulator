    G            Em              Am
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty,
   G           E7            A7     D7
I first set my eyes on sweet Molloy Malone.
     G             Em              D7
She wheeled a wheelbarrow, through streets broad and narrow,
         G           D       Am Em   D    G
Crying: Cockles and Mussels, Alive, Alive O.

Chorus:
 G           Em
Alive, alive O,
  Am         D7
Alive, alive O,
         G           D
Crying, Cockles and Mussels,
Am Em   D7   G
Alive, alive O.

Verse Two:
    G         Em          Am
She was a fishmonger, and sure twas no wonder,
    G           E7         A7     D7
For so were her Father and Mother before.
             G             Em               D7
And they all wheeled their barrows, through streets broad and narrow,
        G          D        Am Em   D    G
Crying Cockles and Mussels, Alive, alive O.

Chorus:

Verse Three:
    G         Em         Am
She died of a fever, and no one to grieve her,
    G            E7           A7      D7
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.
        G                Em              D7
Now her ghost wheels her barrow, through streets broad and narrow,
        G           D        Am Em   D    G
Crying: Cockles and Mussels, alive, alive O.

Chorus:
