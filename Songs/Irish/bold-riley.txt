Bold Riley 
 
Oh the rain it rains all day long,
Bold Riley-o, Bold Riley,
And the northern wind, it blows so strong,
Bold Riley-o has gone away.
 
Goodbye my sweetheart,
goodbye my dear-o
Bold Riley-o, Bold Riley,
Goodbye my darlin',
goodbye my dear-o,
Bold Riley-o has gone away.
 
Well come on, Mary, don't look glum,
Bold Riley-o, Bold Riley,
Come White-stocking Day . you'll be drinkin' rum
Bold Riley-o has gone away.
 
CHORUS
 
We're outward bound for the Bengal Bay,
Bold Riley-o, Bold Riley,
Get bending, me lads,
it's a hell-of-a-way,
Bold Riley-o has gone away.
