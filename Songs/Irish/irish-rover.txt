        G                        C   
    In the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and six
           G                           D
    We set sail from the sweet Cobh of Cork
            G                   C
    We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
            G          D           G
    For the Grand City Hall in New York
            G
    'Twas a wonderful craft
            D
    She was rigged fore and aft
        G                     D
    And oh, how the wild wind drove her
              G      
    She stood several blasts
             Em                (pause)
    She had twenty seven masts 
             G                    D  G
    And they called her The Irish Rover


           G                       C
    We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
           G                       D
    We had two million barrels of stone
           G                          C
    We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
           G            D          G
    We had four million barrels of bones
           G
    We had five million hogs
        D
    And six million dogs
    G                        D
    Seven million barrels of porter
           G                  
    We had eight million bails
           Em                 (pause)
    of old nanny-goats' tails
           G                 D   G
    In the hold of the Irish Rover

        G                           C   
    There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
           G                       D
    There was Hogan from County Tyrone
           G                          C
    There was Johnny McGirr who was scared stiff of work
           G            D          G
    And a man from Mallow called Malone
           G
    There was Slugger O'Toole
        D
    Who was drunk as a rule
        G                        D
    And Fighting Bill Treacy from Dover
           G                  
    And your man, Mick MacCann
           Em                 (pause)
    From the banks of the Bann
           G                     D   G
    Was the skipper of the Irish Rover


        G                           C   
    We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
           G                       D
    And the ship lost its way in the fog
           G                          C
    And that whale of a crew was reduced down to two
           G            D          G
    Just myself and the Captain's old dog
           G
    Then the ship struck a rock
        D
    Oh Lord what a shock
        G                        D
    The bulkhead was turned right over
           G                  
    Turned nine times around
           Em                         (pause)
    And the poor old dog was drowned
           G                  D   G
    I'm the last of The Irish Rover
