G 
Wish I was in London,
        D7 
Or some other seaport town;
        
I'd set my foot in a steamboat,
   C              G 
I'd sail the ocean 'round.
 
G 
While sailing a round the ocean,
            D7 
While sailing a round the sea,

I'd think of handsome Molly
   C              G 
Wherever she might be.
 

She rode to church a-Sunday,
She passed me on by;
I saw her mind was changing
By the roving of her eye.
(Handsome Molly! Oh, you little Molly!)
 
 
Don't you remember, Molly,
When you gave me your right hand ?
You said if you  ever marry
That I'd be the man.
 

Now you've broke your promise,
Go home with who you please,
While my poor heart is aching
You're lying at your ease.


Hair was black as a raven,
Her eyes was black as coal,
Her cheeks was like lilies
Out in the morning grown.
