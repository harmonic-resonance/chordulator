         Am  D              G    Em
I wish I was,   in Carrickfergus
        Am     D         G
Only for nights, in Ballygrant
            Am  D           G     Em
I would swim over the deepest ocean
            Am   D                G
The deepest ocean to be by your side
                G                      D
But the sea is wide and I can’t swim over
            Em               Am
And nor have I the wings to fly
        Am  D              G    Em
If I could find me a handy boatman
              Am  D              G   
To ferry me over to my love and die
 
             Am  D                  G        Em
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
        Am  D              G
Of happy time spend so long ago.
              Am  D              G    Em
My boyhood friends and my own relations
                    Am  D              G
Have all passed on like the melting snow
             G               D
I’ll spend my days in endless roving
             Em                 Am
Soft is the grass and my bed is free
        Am  D              G    Em
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus
                 Am  D                 G
On the long road down to the salty sea
 
            Am  D          G    Em
And in Kilkenny it is reported
        Am  D              G  
On marble stone as black as ink
          Am      D           G    Em
With gold and silver I did support her
                     Am  D               G
But I’ll sing no more now till I get a drink
              G                       D
For I’m drunk today and I’m rarely sober
            Em                 Am
A handsome rover from town to town
                 Am  D              G    Em
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered
                 Am  D               G
so come on ye young men and lay me down
