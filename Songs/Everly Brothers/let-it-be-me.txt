C           G7
I bless the day I found you  
Am        Em
I want to stay around you 
F        C
And so I beg you 
F         C
Let it be me 

               G7
Don’t take this heaven from one 
Am          Em
If you must cling to someone 
F       C
Now and forever 
F         C
Let it be me 

F            Em
Each time we meet love 
F      C
I find complete love 
F            C
Without your sweet love 
F               E
What would life be 

C        G7
So never leave me lonely 
Am          Em
Tell me you love me only 
F               C
And that you’ll always 
F         C
Let it be me 

F            Em
Each time we meet love 
F      C
I find complete love 
F            C
Without your sweet love 
F               E
What would life be 

C        G7
So never leave me lonely 
Am          Em
Tell me you love me only 
F               C
And that you’ll always 
F         C
Let it be me
