There goes my baby with someone new 
              G7               C
She sure looks happy  I sure am blue 
      C7  F                    G7

I'm through with romance I'm through with love 
                G7                 C
I'm through with counting the stars above 
          C7  F                  G7
And here's the reason that I'm so free 
                              C
My loving baby is through with me
