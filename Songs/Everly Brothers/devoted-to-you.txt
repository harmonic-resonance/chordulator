C               G7       C
Darling you can count on me 
                  G7     C
Till the sun dries up the sea 
F     G7        F      C
Until then I’ll always be 
  G7       C
De-voted to you 

                     G7      C
I’ll be yours through endless time 
               G7        C
I’ll adore your charms sublime 
F        G7      F
Guess by now you know that  
C     G7       C
I’m devoted to you 

F                   C
I’ll never hurt you I’ll never lie
G7              C
I’ll never be untrue 
F                   C
I’ll never give you reason to cry 
G7
I’d be unhappy if you were blue 

C                    G7        C
Through the years my love will grow 
            G7      C
Like a river it will flow 
              F
It can’t die because 
   C    G7       C
I’m so devoted to you
