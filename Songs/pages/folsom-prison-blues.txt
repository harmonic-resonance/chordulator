Intro: train whistle on harmonica

E
I hear the train a comin' 

It's rollin' 'round the bend 

And I ain't seen the sunshine 
E7 
Since, I don't know when 
A
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison 
E
And time keeps dra-------ggin' on 
B7
But that train keeps a-rollin' 
A(once) ----- E
On down to San Antone 


E
When I was just a baby 

My Mama told me, "Son 

Always be a good boy 
E7
Don't ever play with guns" 
A
But I shot a man in Reno 
E
Just to watch him die 
B7
When I hear that whistle blowin' 
A(once) ----- E
I hang my head and cry 


E
I bet there's rich folks eatin' 

In a fancy dining car 

They're probably drinkin' coffee 
E7
And smokin' big cigars 
A
But I know I had it comin' 
E
I know I can't be free 
B7
But those people keep a-movin' 
A(once) ----- E
And that's what tortures me 


E
Well, if they freed me from this prison 

If that railroad train was mine 

I bet I'd move it on a little 
E7
Farther down the line 
A
Far from Folsom Prison 
E
That's where I want to stay 
B7
And I'd let that lonesome whistle 
A(once) ----- E
Blow my blues away
