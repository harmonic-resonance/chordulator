I have been thinking about music. (mm-hmm)
I guess you know that I really love music
Its been very very important to me since I was very little

We can sing together

I just felt like dancing as I was singing
(I just felt like dancing, felt like dancing)

(I just felt like dancing, felt like dancing)

(talk to the people you love last night?)
about things that you wonder about

there’s so much in this world we can learn
no matter how young or how old we are
(we can sing together)

the truth is inside of us
(the truth is inside of us)
and it’s wonderful when we have the courage to tell it

are you discovering the truth about you?
(truth about you, truth about you)
That’s what we do as we keep growing in life
(that’s what we do)
are you discovering the truth about you?
(that’s what we do)
I’m still discovering the truth about me
(truth about me, truth about me)

When people are honest with each other
They’re able to do all kinds of fine things

After you’ve heard someone play beautiful music
Sometimes you just like to have a quiet time to remember it. 
Let’s just sit and think about what we’ve heard.
