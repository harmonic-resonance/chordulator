Intro:
------

AD, AD, AD, EF#m [repeat]

DA

Verse:
------

The wretched desert takes it's form, 
AD/A

The jackal proud and tight,
A

In search of you I feel my way,
AD/A

Through slowest heaving night
A

Whatever fear invents, 
DDsus4

I swear it make no sense
A

I reach out through the border fence
BmG

Come down, come talk to me
A

In the swirling curling storm of desire
Unuttered words hold fast
With reptile tongue the lightning lashes
Towers built to last
Darkness creeps in like a thief
And offers no relief
Why are you shaking like a leaf?
Come on, come talk to me

Chorus:
-------
Ah please talk to me
A/C#D

Won't you please talk to me
A/C#D

We can unlock this misery
A/C#D

Come on, come talk to me
EF#m

I did not come to steal
A/C#D

This all is so unreal
A/C#D

Can't you show me how you feel
A/C#D

Come on, come talk to me
EF#m

Come talk to me, come talk to me
DA

[verse]
The earthly power sucks shadowed milk,
From sleepy tears undone
From nippled skin as smooth as silk,
The bugles blow as one
You lie there with your eyes half closed,
Like there's no-one there at all
There's a tension pulling on your face
Come on, come talk to me

[chorus]
Won't you please talk to me
If you'd just talk to me
Unblock this misery
If you'd only talk to me
Don't you ever change your mind
Now your future's so defined
And you act so deaf so blind
Come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me, come talk to me

Bridge:
-------
I can imagine the moment
A

Breaking out through the silence
D/A

All the things that we both might say
A

And the heart it will not be denied
AD/A

'Til we're both on the same damn side
A

All the barriers blown away

[chorus]
I said please talk to me
Won't you please come talk to me
Just like it used to be
Come on, come talk to me
I did not come to steal
This all is so unreal
Can you show me how you feel now
Come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me, come talk to me

I said please talk to me
If you'd just talk to me
Unblock this misery
If you'd only talk to me
Don't you ever change your mind
Now your future's so defined
And you act so deaf so blind
Come on, come talk to me
Come talk to me, come talk to me
