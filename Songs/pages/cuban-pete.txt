They call me Cuban Pete, 
I'm the king of the rhumba beat

when I play my 
maracas I go 

chick chicky boom, 
chick chicky boom



Yes sir I'm Cuban Pete, 
I'm the craze of my native street

when I start to dance 
everything goes

chick chicky boom, 
chick chicky boom



The senoritas, they sing and they swing with terampero

It's very nice, so full of spice

And when they dancin they bring 
a happy ring that era keros

singin a song, all the day long



so If you like the beat, take a lesson from cuban pete,

and I'll teach you to 
chick chicky boom, 
chick chicky boom, 
chick chicky boom



Senora or Senorita solo: (optional)



They call me sally sweet, I'm the queen of delancy street

when I start to dance 
everything goes

chick chicky boom, 
chick chicky boom



Excuse me Mr. Pete, (yes maam)

Have the cubans a different beat?

If they have will you 
teach me to 

chick chicky boom, 
chick chicky boom



verse 2 (male solo)

It's very nice, so full of spice

I'll place my hand on your hip and if you will just give me your hand

then we shall try, just you and I. I yi



so if you like the beat take a lesson from cuban pete

and I'll teach you to 

chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom!!!! :)
