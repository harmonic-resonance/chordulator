VINCENT – Don McLean

  G Am

Starry starry  night, paint your palette  blue and grey

  C D7 G

Look out on a  summer's day with  eyes that know the darkness in my 
soul

  G Am

Shadows on the  hills, sketch the trees and the  daffodills

  C D7 G C G

Catch the breeeze and the  winter chills, in  colors on the snowy linen 
land      

  Am D7 G

Now I under stand  what you tried to  say to me

Em Am7 D7 Em

How you suffered for you  sanity  How you tried to set them  free

  A7 Am7 D7 G

They would not listen they did  not know  how     Perhaps they'll
listen  now

  G Am

Starry starry  night, flaming flowers that  brightly blaze

  C D7 G

Swirling clouds in  violet haze  reflect in Vincent's eyes of chine 
blue

  G Am

Colors changing  hue, morning fields of amber  grain

  C D7 G C G

Weathered faces  lined in pain are  soothed 'neath the artists's loving 
hand

  G Am7 D7 G F# E

  For they could not  love you,  but still your love was  true       

  Am7 Cm

And when no  hope was left in sight, on that  starry starry night

  G F7 E7

You  took your life as  lovers often  do,

  Am7

But I  could have told you, Vincent,

  C D7 G

This  world was never meant for one as  beautiful as you 

  G Am

Starry, starry  night, portraits hung in  empty halls

  C D7 G

Frameless heads on  nameless walls with  eyes that watch the world and
can't for get.

  G Am

Like the stranger that you've  met, the ragged man in  ragged clothes

  C D7 G C G

The silver thorn of  bloody rose, lie  crushed and broken on the virgin 
snow       

  Am D7 G

Now I th ink I know  what you tried to  say to me

  Em Am7 D7 Em

  How you suffered for you  sanity  How you tried to set them  free

  A7 Am7 D7

They would not listen they're  not listening  still   

  G

Perhaps they never  will.
