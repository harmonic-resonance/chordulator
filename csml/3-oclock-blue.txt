THREE O”CLOCK BLUES – B B King


Now here it is three o'clock in the mornin'

Can't even close my eyes

Oh, three o' clock in the mornin', baby

Can't even close my eyes

Well, I can't find my baby

Lord, and I can't be satisfied


Lord, I've looked around me

Whoa, my baby can't be found

Whoa, looked all around me, people

Whoa, my baby can't be found

Well, if I don't find my baby

I'm goin' down to the boilin' ground, that's where the mens hang out


(break)


Well, goodbye, everybody

Lord, I believe this is the end

Oh, goodbye, everybody

Lord, I believe this is the end

Just want to tell my baby to figure me for my sins
