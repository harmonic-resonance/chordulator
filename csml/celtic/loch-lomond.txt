C Am F G
By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes 
C Am F G
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,
F Am Dm F(1/2) 
Where me and my true love were ever wont to be,
G7 (1/2)C Am Dm(1/2) G(1/2) C(x2)
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lo - mond. 


CHORUS
C Am F G
Oh! You'll take the high road, and I'll take the low, 
C Am F G
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye,
F Am Dm F(1/2) 
But me and my true love will never meet again, 
G7 (1/2) C Am Dm(1/2) G(1/2) C(x2)
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lo - mond. 

C Am F G
'Twas then that we parted, in yon shady glen 
C Am F G
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond,
F Am Dm F(1/2) 
Where in purple hue, the Highland hills we view
G7(1/2) C Am Dm(1/2) G(1/2) C(x2)
And the moon coming out in the gloam - ing.

Chorus

C Am F G
The wee birdies sing, and the wildflowers spring 
C Am F G
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping, 
F Am Dm F(1/2) 
But the broken heart will ken no second spring again, 
G7 (1/2) C Am Dm(1/2) G(1/2) C(x2)
Tho' the woeful may cease frae their grie - ving.

Chorus
