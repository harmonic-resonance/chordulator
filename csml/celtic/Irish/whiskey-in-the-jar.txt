   C                    Am
As I was going over the far fam'd Kerry Mountains,
  F                                C            G
I met with Captain Farrel, and his money he was countin',
  C                               Am
I first produced my pistol, and I than produced my rapier,
         F                         C
Sayin': "Stand and deliver for you are a bold deceiver". 

Chorus:
      G
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da,
C
Whack for the daddy ol',
F
Whack for the daddy ol',
        C       G      C
There's whiskey in the jar. 

   C                           Am
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,
  F                          C               G
I put it in my pocket, and I took it home to Jenny,
    C                               Am
She sighed, and she swore that she never would deceive me,
         F                            C
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy.

Chorus
   C                           Am
I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber,
  F                          C               G
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder,
    C                               Am
But Jenny drew my charges and she filled them out with water,
         F                            C
Then sent for Captain Farrel, to be ready for the slaughter.

Chorus

   C                           Am
'Twas early in the morning just before I rose to travel,
    F                          C                 G
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise, Captain Farrel,
    C                               Am
I first produced my pistol for she stole away my rapier,
         F                            C
But I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.

Chorus

    C                                Am
Now there's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
    F                          C                 G
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
    C                               Am
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
         F                            C
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

Chorus

    C                                Am
If anyone can aid me 'tis my brother in the army,
    F                          C                 G
If I can find his station, in Cork or in Killarney,
    C                               Am
And if he'll go with me we'll go roving in Kilkenny,
         F                            C
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my old a-sporting Jenny.

Chorus (2x)
