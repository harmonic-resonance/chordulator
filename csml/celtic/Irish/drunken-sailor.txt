Am
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
G
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
Am
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
G              Am
Ear-lye in the mornin'?

Am
Way, hey, an' up she rises,
G
Way, hey, an' up she rises,
Am
Way, hey, an' up she rises,
G              Am
Ear-lye in the morning.

Put him in the longboat 'till he's sober...

Keep him there and make him bail 'er...

Give him a dose of salt and water...

Shave his belly with a rusty razor...

Put him in bed with the captain's daughter...

Am
She looks like an orangutan,
G
She looks like an orangutan,
Am
She looks like an orangutan,
G
Swinging through the rigging.
(chorus)

Am 
There she goes, swinging through the rigging,
G
There she goes, swinging through the rigging,
Am
There she goes, swinging through the rigging,
G
Ear-lye in the morning.
(chorus)

What shall we do with a drunken sailor?...
