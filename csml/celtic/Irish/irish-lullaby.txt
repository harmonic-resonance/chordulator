An Irish Lullaby (Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra)
words and music J.R. Shannon

C                  F          C
Over in Killarney, Many years ago,
   F             C
Me Mither sang a song to me, 
D7                     G7
In tones so sweet and low.
C             F         C
Just a simple little ditty,
       F        C
In her good old Irish way,
        F                 C
And l'd give the world if she could sing
     G7
That song to me this day.

C                      F               F#dim
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  Too-ra-loo-ra-li
C      F        C       D7                 G7 
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral   hush now don't you cry
C                     F                F#dim
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral Too-ra-loo-ra-li
C         F         C            D7    G7     C
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  that's an Irish lull-a-by


Oft in dreams I wander

To that cot again,

I feel her arms a-huggin' me

As when she held me then.

And I hear her voice a -hummin'

To me as in days of yore,

When she used to rock me fast asleep

Outside the cabin door.
