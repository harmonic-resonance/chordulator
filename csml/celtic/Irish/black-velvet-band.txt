Black Velvet Band

      G                                                             D
In a neat little town they call Belfast apprenticed to trade I was bound
     G                     Em          C             D           G
And many an hour of sweet happiness I spent in that neat little town
      G                                                           D
Till bad misfortune came over me and caused me to stray from the land
      G                        Em          C             D           G
Far away from me friends and relations me followed the Black Velvet Band

     G
Her eyes they shown like the diamonds
                                  D
You'd think she was queen of the land
         G                   Em
And her hair hung over her shoulder
     C           D           G
Tied up with a Black Velvet Band

     G                                                       D
Well I went out strolling one evening not meaning to go very far
        G                      Em              C         D         G
When I met with a fickle-some damsel she was plying her trade in a bar
        G                                                          D
When a watch she took from a cutomer and slipped it right into me hand
         G                Em             C             D           G
And the law it came and arrested me bad luck to your Black Velvet Band

      G                                                D
This mornin' before judge and jury a trial I had to appear
         G                       Em          C            D             G
And the judge he says "me young fellow" the case against you is quite clear
      G                                                            D
And seven long years is your sentence you're going to Van Daemons Land
     G                          Em            C          D            G

    G                                                              G
So come all ye jolly young fellows I'll have you take warnin' from me
    G                    Em               C            D         G
Whenever you're into the liquor me lads beware of the pretty colleen
             G                                                          D
For they'll fill you with whiskey and porter till you are not able to stand
         G                        Em                  C         D            G
