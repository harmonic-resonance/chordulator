GRACE Capo 2
 
G                                C                 D
As we gather in the chapel here, in old Kilmainham jail,
C             G                        Am                D
I think about the last few weeks, Oh will they say we failed,
    G                                         C              D
From our school days they have told us we must yearn for liberty,
C              G                        D                   G
Yet all I want in this dark place is to have you here with me.
 
[Chorus]
D                                    C                   G
Oh Grace just hold me in your arms, and let this moment linger,
C                   G         Am      D
They take me out at dawn and I will die,
                                    C               G
With all my love I place this wedding ring upon your finger,
     C                G                D               G
There wont be time to share our love so we must say goodbye.

G                                C                 D
Now I know it's hard for you my love to ever understand,
C             G                        Am                   D
The love I bear for these brave men my love for this brave land,
    G                              C              D
But when Padraic called me to his side down in the G.P.O.
C              G                D                 G
I had to leave my own sick bed, to him I had to go.
 
[Chorus]
 

G                                C                 D
Now as the dawn is breaking,my heart is breaking too,
C             G                        Am              D
As I walk out on this May morn my thoughts will be of you,
    G                                         C              D
And I'll write some words upon the wall so everyone will know,
C              G                    D                   G
I loved so much that I could see his blood upon the rose
