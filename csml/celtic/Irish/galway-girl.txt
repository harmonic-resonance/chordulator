Verse 1:
D                                              
Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk 
     D      A    G                            
On a day -I-ay-I-ay 
D                                              
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
     D         G      D                          
On a fine soft day -I-ay 
      G          D               G        D       
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 
            Bm                    G         D    
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
        G         D           G         D        
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl 
            Bm                   G      D         
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

Verse 2:
D            
We were halfway there when the rain came down 
                 G                             
On a day -I-ay-I-ay 
        D                                     
And she asked me up to her flat downtown 
     D          G          D                    
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay 
      G        D                G        D        
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 
            Bm                    G         D       
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
      G        D          G          D            
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl 
       Bm                G      D                
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

Verse 3:
D                                          G    
When I woke up I was all alone 
         D                              G  D       
With a broken heart and a ticket home 
      G        D            G             D     
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do 
        Bm         A          G          D      
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
            G        D                     G         D       
'Cause I've traveled around. I've been all over this world 
              Bm                       G      D   
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
