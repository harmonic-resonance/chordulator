G C 
Let me tell you all the story of a man named Charlie 
G D7 
On a tragic and fateful day; 
G 
He put ten cents in his pocket, 
C 
Kissed his wife and family, 
G D7 
Went to ride on the M. T. A. 

:REFRAIN: 
G 
But did he ever return? 
C 
No, he never returned, 
G D7 
And his fate is still unlearned. 
G C 
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston, 
G D7 G 
He's the man who never returned. 

Charlie handed in his dime 
At the Kendall Square station, 
And he changed for Jamaica Plain. 
When he got there the conductor told him, 
"One more nickel." 
Charlie couldn't get off of that train. 

But did he ever return... 

All night long Charlie rides through the station, 
Crying, "What will become of me? 
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea 
Or my cousin in Roxbury?" 

But did he ever return... 

Charlie's wife goes down 
To the Scully Square station 
Every day at a quarter past two. 
And through the open window 
She hands Charlie a sandwich 
As the train comes rumbling through. 

But did he ever return... 

Now, you citizens of Boston, 
Don't you think it's a scandal 
How the people have to pay and pay? 
Fight the fare increase, vote for George O'Ryan! 
Get poor Charlie off the M. T. A. 

Or else he'll never return..
