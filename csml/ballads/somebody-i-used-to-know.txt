Somebody I Used to Know
capo 5 version
Am, G, F

Intro: Am, G, Am, G x5

Verse:
AmGAmGAmGAmG
Now and then I think of when we were together

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

Told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

Am, G, Am, G x4

Verse 2:
Am, G, Am, G, Am,G, Am, G
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end

Always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

Chorus:
AmGFG
But you didn't have to cut me off
AmGF
Make out like it never happened
GAm
And that we were nothing
GFG
And I don't even need your love
AmG
But you treat me like a stranger
FG
And that feels so rough

You didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records

And then change your number

I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Verse 3:
AmGAmGAmGAmG
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
AmGFGAmGAmG
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
FAmG
And I don't wanna live that way
FAmG
Reading into every word you say
FAmG
You said that you could let it go
FAmG
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

Chorus:
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


AmGFG
I used to know
AmGFG
That I used to know x2

AmGFG
Somebody...

Ends on Am
