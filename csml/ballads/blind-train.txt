Intro: AmDAmD
Verse 1:
AmDAm
The color of my hair is changing.
AmDAm
My skin is soft to soft for a man my age.
DAm
And I am never alone.
D
Where is time taking me?

Chorus:
GEmG
Nothing is real This is how I feel
GEmAm
Nothing is wrong, but everything takes too long.

Verse 2:
AmDAm
How did this end up me against you?
DAm
Is everything that I say and everything you do?
DAm
Your smile is changing, yeah
D
Where is time taking you?
GEmG
Nothing is real This is how I feel
GEm
Nothing is good
EmG
But I don't mind being blind
GEmG
If you don't mind doing time.
GEmAm
Nothing is wrong everything takes to long
AmDAm
Hey by the way I fell to your way side
DAm
Did I crash or just slide
DAm
Hey by the way, I pull myself up to your way side
D
Did I hurt you or just slide in?

Solo (Chords just repeat as for a verse)

Verse 3

So this is how it feels to get a little older
DAm
Some would say wiser
AmD
We know what that means
AmD
Maybe not maybe that's what THAT means maybe not
GEmG
Nothing is real This is how I feel
GEm
Nothing is good
EmG
But I don't mind being blind
GEmGEm
If you don't mind doing time.
