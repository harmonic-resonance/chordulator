Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
CDm
I'm beggin' of you please don't take my man
FCDm
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
CDm
Please don't take him just because you can

DmF
Your beauty is beyond compare
CDm
With flaming locks of auburn hair
CDm
With iv'ry skin and eyes of emerald green


DmF
Your smile is like a breath of spring
CDm
Your voice is soft like summer rain
CDm
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene


DmF
He talks about you in his sleep
CDm
And there is nothing I can do
CDm
To keep from crying when he calls your name, Jolene


DmF
And I can easily understand
CDm
How you could easily take my man
CDm
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
