Fade into You

DAEm
I want to hold the hand inside you
DAEm
I want to take a breath that's true
DAEm
I look to you and I see nothing
DAEm
I look to you to see the truth
DAm
You live your life
Em
You go in shadows
DAEm
You'll come apart and you'll go black
DAmEm
Some kind of night into your darkness
DAEm
Colors your eyes with what's not there. 

CHORUS

GDC
Fade into you
GDC
Strange you never knew
GDC
Fade into you
GDEm
I think it's strange you never knew 


(Repeats throughout)

A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then smiles cover your heart 

CHORUS
(Repeat 2x)
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew 

I think it's strange you never knew (Repeat 2x)
