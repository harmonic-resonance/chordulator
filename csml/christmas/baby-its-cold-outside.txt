I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside

DmG7DmG7
I've got to go away
But baby it's cold outside

CCmaj7CC
The evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in

Gm7Gm7C7C7
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

FFFF
My mother will start worry
Beautiful what’s your hurry?

FmFmFmFm
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar

CCCC
So really i'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry

DmDmGG
But maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour

CCmaj7CCmaj7
The neighbors might think
Baby it's bad out there

DmG7DmG7
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there

CCmaj7CC
I wish i knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now

Gm7Gm7C7C7
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

FFFF
I ought to say, "No, no, no sir"
Mind if I move in closer

FmFmG7G7
At least i'm gonna say that i tried
What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?

CBb7A7A7
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out

D7G7CC
Ah, but it's cold outside
