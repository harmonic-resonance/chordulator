"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"

[Hank Williams cover]

Hear the lonesome whipperwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

I never seen a night so long
When times goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide it's face and cry

Well maybe the night is cold
But together they fade
Like the shadow that ran up to the hills
Trying to fix her wings
There's a saint and a sinner
and forever the missing day
Where the winners and the losers feel the same
Who knows what tomorrow brings

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights a purple sky
And I wonder where you are
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

Well maybe the night is cold
But together they fade
Like the shadow that ran up to the hills
Trying to fix her wings
There's a saint and a sinner
and forever the missing day
Where the winners and the losers feel the same
Who knows what tomorrow brings

Hear the lonesome whipperwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
