When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school. 
F#mBEF#mBE
Its a wonder I can think at all. 
EE7A
and though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none. 
F#mBE
I can read the writing on the wall


CHORUS:
AC#mF#mBmE
Kodachro oh ohm give us those nice bright colors 
AD
give us the greens of summers 
BEAC#mF#m
makes you think all the worlds a sunny day oh ya
BmE
I got a Nikon camera 
AD
I love to take the photographs
BEAC#mF#mB /
so momma don't take my kodachrome away

VERSE 2
EE7
If you took all the girls I new when I was single
F#mBEF#mB
and brought em all together for one night
EEmaj7E7
I know they never match my sweet imagination
F#mBEE7
and everything looks worse in black and white

CHORUS:
AC#mF#mBmE
Kodachro oh ohm give us those nice bright colors 
AD
give us the greens of summers 




BEAC#mF#m
makes you think all the worlds a sunny day oh ya
BmE
I got a Nikon camera 
AD
I love to take the photographs
BEAC#mF#m
so momma don't take my kodachrome away

momma don't take my kodachrome away 0///
