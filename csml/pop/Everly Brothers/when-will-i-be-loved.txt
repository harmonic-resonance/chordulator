G         C          G         C
I’ve been made blue  I’ve been lied to 
G         C    G
When will I be loved 
         C            G         C
I’ve been turned down  I’ve been pushed round 
G         C    G
When will I be loved 

C             D7       C               G
When I meet a new girl that I want for mine 
   C                D7              C             D7
She always breaks my heart in two it happens every time 
G         C        G       C
I’ve been cheated  been mistreated 
G         C    G
When will I be loved 

C             D7       C               G
When I meet a new girl that I want for mine 
   C                D7              C             D7
She always breaks my heart in two it happens every time 
G         C        G       C
I’ve been cheated  been mistreated 
G         C    G
When will I be loved 
         C    G
When will I be loved
