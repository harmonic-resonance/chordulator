G

Don't you worry there my honey

C

We might not have any money

Em C

But we've got our love to pay the bills

G

Maybe I think you're cute and funny

C

Maybe I want to do what bunnies

Em C

do with you, if you know what I mean

  Chorus:

  G B7 C

  Oh let's get rich and build our parents' homes

  G

  in the South of France;

  G Em

  Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and

  C D

  teach them how to dance;

  G B7

  Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain makin'

  Em C

  everybody look like ants;

  G D G

  From way up there, you and I, you and I.

G

(Male)Well you might be a bit confused

C

(Female) And you might be a little bit bruised

Em C

(Male)But baby how we spoon like no one else;

G

(Male)So I will help you read those books

C

(Male)If you will soothe my worried looks

Em C

(Together)And we will put the lonesome on the shelf;

Chorus

Acapella Chorus (with double stomps and single claps)
