I may be just a foolish dreamer

 
But I don't care
'Cause I know my happiness is waiting out there somewhere
I'm searching for that silver lining
Horizons that I've never seen
Oh I'd like to take just a moment and dream my dream
Ohhh Dream my dream

Ohhh Zoom
I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind is fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

 
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Ohh I'd like the greet the sun each morning
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey in my life, in my life
Well I've shared so many pains
And I've played so many games
Ohh but everyone finds the right way
Somehow
Somewhere
Someday

Ohhh Zoom
I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can be fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
People can be what they wanna be

Ohhhhh I wish the world were truly happy
Living as one
I wish the word they call freedom someday would come
Someday would come

Ohhh Zoom
I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can be fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Everybody can be what they wanna be Hey, Hey Hey Hey Hey Baby

Zoom
I'd like to fly away
Zoom
I'd like to fly away
Zoom
I'd like to fly away
You and me, baby
Walking free
Don't you wanna go?
Don't you wanna go?
