Look yonder coming a-coming down that railroad track 
    F                                              C
Hey look yonder coming a-coming down that railroad track 
         G7                                       C
It's the Orange Blossom Special  bringing my baby back 
 
                                                        C7
Well I'm going down to Florida  and get some sand in my shoes 
   F                                         C
Or maybe California  and get some sand in my shoes  
               G7                                               C
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special  and loose these New York blues 
 
 
Say man when you going back to Florida  back to Florida I don't know   
 
I don't reckon I ever will  but ain't you worried bout getting your own 
                          G7                                          C
Nourishment in New York   well I don't care if I do die do die do die do   


                                                           C7
Hey talk about her rambling she's the fastest train on the line 
    F                                                        C
Hey talk about her traveling  she's the fastest train on the line 
          G7                                                C
It's that Orange Blossom Special  rolling down the seaboard line
